All the requirements of the assignment have been met, with MongoDB now providing the datastore and ReactJS is used to create a single page app version of the application, at {host}/spa. The SPA requires a user to be authenticated to access it, and a user can only post when on their own post list. Websockets are used to maintain a connection between server and client, with new posts sent to subscribing clients.
